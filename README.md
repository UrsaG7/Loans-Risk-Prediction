## About The Project

Home Credit Final Project
This project is about maximizing the usage of data in order to create an acurate and reliable credit score prediction machine learning model. 

What the model hope to achieve:

* Give a clear and concise insight
* Able to adapt to new foreign data

I plan to continously work on these as to perfect my craft and further hone my skill.
